# 401k Casino 

A tongue-in-cheek React single-page app for a school project. The concept riffs on a fictional casino where players gamble their 401k — purely satire, absolutely not financial advice.

## Getting Started

```bash
cd casino-401k-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This boots a Vite dev server and opens the page in your browser.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite dev server with hot reloading
- `npm run build` – bundle the app for production into `dist/`
- `npm run preview` – serve the production build locally

## Project Structure

- `src/App.jsx` – top-level layout composing the major sections
- `src/components/` – reusable UI building blocks for header, hero, games, etc.
- `src/data/games.js` – satirical game listings rendered on the landing page
- `src/styles.css` – global styles for the entire experience

## Notes

- Built with React 18 and Vite for fast development cycles.
- Includes ESLint with React and accessibility presets.
- Remember: **this project is satire**; do not gamble your real retirement savings.
